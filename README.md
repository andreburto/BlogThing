This project was started and mostly abandoned in 2010. It's a WinForms VB.NET blogging project. The only really intersting part of it is that it has a simple template parsing system built-in. Crude as it that template parser is, it's powerful enough to handle variables.

I'm hoping to revitalize this project and turn it into something akin to Marc Canter's [Persona Editor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRoRMzE8Uc&list=FLLrC4Za37X3vvgdDcfTUPEg&index=3). **BlogThing** will not be that project, but at its core lies several principles I intent to use.
